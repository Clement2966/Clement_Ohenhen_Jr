To Get a C:

Issues with design - This is the control interface for Texas Tech's Weymouth Dorm Elevator elevator.At first there looks like the design of this elvator is perfectly fine and nothing out of sorts. But as someone who used to stay at this dorm my freshman year there's more that meets the eye of this design. From the scatter of the the button layout.

Explanation - When entering the elevator the control panel to go up and down. The buttons have a delay that intervenes with the elevator as a whole. As you can in the GIF, I tried multiple times pressing on the interface of which floor I wanted but it didn't give me any feedback until I had to press multiple times. Due to GIF ending it took me to another floor that didn't recognized my input. From experience from my freshman year and reports to my little brother who's a freshman, the elevator would ignore the what was input thats on the interface and would progress to another floor. And even at times it would get stuck

So I decided my that this interface needs to be upgraded towards a more touchscreen modern day elevator.



To Get a B:

Form of transport for people from one bottom to the coming.
Moving heavy objects from one bottom to another for illustration in construction work.
Express elevators used to move people from lobby bottom to one of the loftiest bottoms skipping over other bottoms.
Some parking garages use elevators to get people and buses from one bottom to the coming.
Rare Uses-
Stage lift elevator to raise and lower sections of a stage.
Dummbwaiters are small elevators used to transport small objects or loads like food or books.
Does the interface make doing those common effects easier? Yes because it allows the stoner to know where they're transporting to.
What's the common sequence of conduct? stoner presses up or down button. Elevator doors open. stoner presses another button depending on what bottom they want to go to. Elevator rises or lowers. Once bottom is reached elevator doors open on new bottom.

How does the elevator support the stoner figure out how to make it work? The operation of buttons, figures, and simple descriptions of what each bottom is for.
How does the elevator give feedback to the stoner? Color illustrations and sound. When a button is pressed it lights up to show that it has been pressed. Sound when elevator doors open and close.
