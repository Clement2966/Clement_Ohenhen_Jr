To Get a C:

Issues with design - This is the control interface for Texas Tech's Weymouth Dorm Elevator elevator.At first there looks like the design of this elvator is perfectly fine and nothing out of sorts. But as someone who used to stay at this dorm my freshman year there's more that meets the eye of this design. From the scatter of the the button layout.

Explanation - When entering the elevator the control panel to go up and down. The buttons have a delay that intervenes with the elevator as a whole. As you can in the GIF, I tried multiple times pressing on the interface of which floor I wanted but it didn't give me any feedback until I had to press multiple times. Due to GIF ending it took me to another floor that didn't recognized my input. From experience from my freshman year and reports to my little brother who's a freshman, the elevator would ignore the what was input thats on the interface and would progress to another floor. And even at times it would get stuck

So I decided my that this interface needs to be upgraded towards a more touchscreen modern day elevator. With the sketch I provided below would detail towsrds that:

Interface review:
Existing interface review with mistakes:
Though the existing interface provides options like up and down arrow on the outer panel, that doesn't make it easier to use as only one control interface exists for two elevators

The elevator as a whole with its design is very outdated and needs to have an upgrade.

My interface:
The interface is easy to use and supports features for people with disabilities and claustrophobia as well

How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?

The operation of buttons, figures, and simple descriptions of what each bottom is for. All features packed onto a touchscreen to give it a more modern design and it removes the out of date, and sometimes problematic buttons and other features that would give trouble towards to user.


How does the elevator give feedback to the user?

Color illustrations and sound. When a button is pressed it lights up to show that it has been pressed. Sound when elevator doors open and close.
